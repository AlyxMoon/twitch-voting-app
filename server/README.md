# Pokket's Voting App - Server

## Database Info
Uses [RethinkDB](https://rethinkdb.com) for the database, find the docs for that [here](https://rethinkdb.com/api/javascript/).

Uses [ThinkAgain](https://github.com/mbroadst/thinkagain) for the ORM, which is a drop-in replacement for [Thinky](https://github.com/neumino/thinky).
The documentation is lacking for Thinkagain, instead you can reference the docs for Thinky which can be found [here](http://justonepixel.com/thinky/documentation/).
